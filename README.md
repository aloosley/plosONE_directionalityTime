# plosONE_directionalityTime
All public data for PLoS ONE paper "Describing Directional Cell Migration with a Characteristic Directionality Time" by Alex Loosley, Xian O'Brien, Jonathan Reichner, and Jay Tang, is contained in this repository.  

### cellTrajSim.m:
This **Trajectory Simulator** simulates a 2D persistent biased random walk (PBRW) using a von Mises distribution to bias the angular direction towards the polar angle $\theta=0$.  Place file in MATLAB path and run help cellTrajSim in MATLAB for implementation details.

### dataForDirTimeManuscript.zip:
This is a **data archive** containing the 2D trajectories of PMNs on soft polyacrylamide gels.  These data were used in the Chemotaxis example described in the manuscript.
